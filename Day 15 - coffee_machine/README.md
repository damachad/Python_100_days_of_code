# Coffee machine â˜•
This program simulates a simple code for a coffee machine. You can choose which drink to take (espresso/latte/cappuccino),
insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), turn the machine off (by typing "off" on the prompt to select drink), 
or see how many resources are still available on the machine (by typing "report" on the prompt).   
You can run the code [here](https://replit.com/@damachad/coffeemachine?v=1).   
The code for this project was written on [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

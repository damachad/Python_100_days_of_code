# Higher lower
This program simulates a version of the game [higher lower](http://www.higherlowergame.com/). 
Essentially, the user has to try to guess which of the two celebrities has more followers. If they got it right, they keep playing, 
this time comparing one of the previous celebrities and a new one. The game goes on until the user guesses incorrectly.
The more right guesses, the higher the final score.   
You can test it out [here](https://replit.com/@damachad/higherlower?v=1).

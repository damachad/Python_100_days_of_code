# Password Manager 🔐
The aim of this project was to create a password manager, where the user can input the name of the website, username/email, and password (or generate a random password) and append them to a file. 
It checks if any field was left empty and asks the user whether the data inserted is correct before saving. If the user generates a password, it is automatically copied to the clipboard.

# Pomodoro Timer üçÖ

A simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and the tkinter library. The [Pomodoro Technique](https://pomofocus.io/) is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features üïí

- Timer intervals: 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5-minute short break, and a 20-minute long break after every 4 work intervals.
- Visual representation of time remaining with a tomato image.
- Keep track of completed work intervals with checkmarks.
- Start and reset buttons to control the timer.

## Usage üöÄ

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required `tkinter` library.
3. Run the `pomodoro_timer.py` script.

Use this Pomodoro Timer to improve your productivity and manage your work sessions effectively. Start the timer, focus on your work during the work intervals, and take short breaks to recharge. The timer will automatically switch between work and break intervals.

## How It Works üßê

- Click the "Start" button to begin a work interval.
- The timer will count down from 25 minutes for work sessions, 5 minutes for short breaks, and 20 minutes for long breaks.
- During work sessions, a "Work" label will be displayed in green.
- During short breaks, a "Break" label will be displayed in pink.
- After completing 4 work intervals, you will receive a long break labeled in red.
- Keep track of your completed work intervals with checkmarks.
- Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset the session.

## Customization üõ†Ô∏è

Feel free to customize the timer intervals (e.g., work duration, break duration) or the appearance of the application to suit your preferences. You can also replace the tomato image with your own.

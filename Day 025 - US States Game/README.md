# U.S. States Game
This is a simple Python project created as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. It's an interactive game based on the [Sporcle's Name the States game](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states), 
that helps you learn the names of the 50 U.S. states by prompting you to guess and identify them on a blank map. 🗺️

## Features 🎮
- Utilizes the turtle graphics library for a graphical interface. 🐢
- Reads state data from a CSV file (50_states.csv) to populate the list of U.S. states. 📊
- Keeps track of correct guesses and saves the missing states to a CSV file (missing_states.csv). 💾
- Allows you to exit the game at any time by typing "exit". 🚪

## How to Play 🕹️
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 📁
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (turtle, pandas) installed. 🐍
3. Run the us_states_game.py script. ▶️
    
The game will display a blank map of the U.S. states. You will be prompted to enter the names of the states one by one. If your guess is correct, it will be marked on the map. You can exit the game at any time by typing "exit". The game will save the list of missing states to missing_states.csv (for later revision). 📝

## Usage 🚀
Feel free to use this project to learn the names of U.S. states in an interactive and engaging way. 🌟   
You can also modify and extend the project as you see fit, adding more features or customizing it to your preferences. 🛠️

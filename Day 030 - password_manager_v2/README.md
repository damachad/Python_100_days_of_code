# Password Manager V2 🔐
This project is an improved version of the one from the [previous day](https://github.com/damachad/Python_exercises/tree/main/Day%20029%20-%20password%20manager), 
with some added features:   
- It allows the user to search for a particular website's login data (while checking if that data has already been saved);
- Creates a JSON file with the saved data;
- Includes error handling and extra pop-ups for when data file does not exist or when data is not present in file.

# ISS overhead notifier üõ∞Ô∏è
This program uses APIs to check if it is nighttime where the user is located (based on the latitude and longitude provided) and if the ISS is passing over that location.
If this is true, it sends an email to the user, notifying them that the ISS is passing their location so they can see it.   
**Note:** This program runs an infinite loop that checks these conditions every 60 seconds.

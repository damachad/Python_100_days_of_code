# U.S. States Game

This project intends to simulate the [Sporcle's Name the States game](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states), where the player has to guess all the names of the 50 states that are part of the USA.
If the player does not know all the states, they can type "exit" and the game ends, creating a .csv file with all the missing states' names (for future revision).
